#  Models

models then __init__
In Models we create get and set for every attribute

#  Services

we need add in the services

we create Interface (abstract class) and actual class of an entity both in Services
interface will have which methods are must for a class

Services wll create objects, call Model -> create object -> callall setter methods 
        -> save the object to inMemory Data Structure DB

# COntrollers

Business logic will be in Controllers
controllers is nearest to user
we write actual business logic on controllers means add the amount to expense, subtract, get Balance etc

We should design our controllers against Interfaces
